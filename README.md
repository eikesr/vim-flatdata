# Vim syntax highlighting for flatdata
Vim syntax highlighting for [flatdata](https://github.com/heremaps/flatdata).

Support for `enum` is the only missing thing currently known to me. If you find bugs or have improvements, please don't hesitate to contribute.

## Using vim-flatdata
If you use Vundle as your vim plugin manager, simply paste this line in your vim config:
```
Plugin 'git://github.com/eikesr/vim-flatdata.git'
```
